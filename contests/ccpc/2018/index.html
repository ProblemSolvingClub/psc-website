                    <p>
                    The Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) provides post-secondary students in Calgary with the opportunity to excel in an ACM ICPC-style programming competition. 
                    Students test their aptitude and knowledge against a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. 
                    Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved within four hours. 
                    The CCPC is sponsored by <a href="http://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</a> and provides a platform for the next generation of computing professionals to pursue excellence.
                    <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a> has graciously sponsored the judging platform.

                    <b>Contest Format</b>
                    Teams of 1-3 students will compete to solve a set of 5-10 programming puzzles over a four hour period. 
                    The set will have a good mix of problems varying both in difficulty and subject domain.
                    Most of the problems can be solved through cleverness rather than specialized knowledge, although the latter is an asset.
                    Common subjects for problems include combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, and geometry.
                    <br><br>
                    For each problem, your program will be given input describing a test case.
                    It must then provide appropriate output giving the answer to whatever problem was posed.
                    Once you have written a solution to the problem, you must submit the solution on <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a>.
                    Your code will be subject to a large battery of tests.
                    If your code returns correct output on every test case and runs within time and memory limits, the solution is accepted.
                    Otherwise, it will be rejected. 
                    You will be told how your program failed, but will not be given details of the failed test case.
                    <br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Read the problems, identify the easiest ones, and solve them first </li>
                        <li> If you're having trouble identifying easy problems, look at the scoreboard to see what others are solving </li>
                        <li> Computer time is very valuable, so sketch out your program on paper before coding it (unless it's trivially simple) </li>
                        <li> Working together on a problem is usually a bad idea and just leads to confusion; assign problems, work in parallel </li>
                        <li> Debugging a program on paper is more effective than sticking print statements everywhere, 99% of the time </li>
                        <li> Come up with your own test cases for your program, especially edge cases </li>
                        <li> Have fun!
