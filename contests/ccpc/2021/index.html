                    <p>
                    The Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) provides post-secondary students in Calgary with the opportunity to excel in an ACM ICPC-style programming competition. 
                    Students test their aptitude and knowledge against a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. 
                    Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved within four hours. 
                    The CCPC is sponsored by <a href="http://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</a> and provides a platform for the next generation of computing professionals to pursue excellence.
                    <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a> has graciously sponsored the judging platform.

                    <b>Contest Format</b>
                    Teams of up to three students enrolled in an Albertan educational institution, meeting the criteria linked to in the "Eligibility" section above may compete for prizes. 
                    Teams not meeting these requirements may participate in the open division. The contest is free of charge for entry. The contest will be held online.
                    <br><br>
                    Don't have a group of people to participate in the event with but you're looking to meet some new people? 
                    No worries! We'll be working to team folks up after you sign up on this Google sheet form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXtoKHKP_Yt7_LdzAA_mJtlWB-I2zRI2_hMvk4QAgn7PWFhA/viewform">here</a>
                    <br><br>
                    The contest itself is a collection of 6-10 problems to be solved using C, C++, Java, Python, or Haskell. Team rankings are decided first by number of problems solved, and second by time taken to solve.
                    For each problem, your program will be given input describing a test case.
                    It must then provide appropriate output giving the answer to whatever problem was posed.
                    Once you have written a solution to the problem, you must submit the solution on <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a>.
                    Your code will be subject to a large battery of tests.
                    If your code returns correct output on every test case and runs within time and memory limits, the solution is accepted.
                    Otherwise, it will be rejected. 
                    You will be told how your program failed, but will not be given details of the failed test case.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Official Rules:</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Accepted programming languages are C, C++, Java, Python 2, Python 3, and Haskell</li>
                        <li> Input from standard in, output to standard out</li>
                        <li> No collaboration is allowed with anyone outside of your team members when working on/discussing the contest problems. </li>
                        <li> All contestants can work on their personal computer. Any team member can submit a solution to Kattis. </li>
                        <li> Resource access is restricted to standard library and language documentation, the contest website, and the I/O cheat-sheet (linked below) </li>
                        <li> Any standard system software may be used during the contest</li>
                        <li> External libraries are not allowed. For example, the C++ header #include is allowed since it is a part of the language's standard library. However, headers in an external C++ library such as Boost are not allowed. </li>
                        <li> Aside from the two main points above, all other references materials on the internet are not allowed </li>
                        <li> Use of electronic devices other than the computer is strictly prohibited </li>
                        <li> Teams are ranked according to which has solved the most problems, with ties broken by time taken to solve </li>

                    <i>Strategies:</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Read the problems, identify the easiest ones, and solve them first </li>
                        <li> If you're having trouble identifying easy problems, look at the scoreboard to see what others are solving </li>
                        <li> Computer time is very valuable, so sketch out your program on paper before coding it (unless it's trivially simple) </li>
                        <li> Working together on a problem is usually a bad idea and just leads to confusion; assign problems, work in parallel </li>
                        <li> Debugging a program on paper is more effective than sticking print statements everywhere, 99% of the time </li>
                        <li> Come up with your own test cases for your program, especially edge cases </li>
                        <li> Have fun!
