                    <p>
                    The Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) provides post-secondary students in Calgary with the opportunity to excel in an ACM ICPC-style programming competition. 
                    Students test their aptitude and knowledge against a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. 
                    Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved within five hours. 
                    The CCPC is sponsored by <a href="https://www.blackduck.com//">Black Duck</a> and provides a platform for the next generation of computing professionals to pursue excellence.
                    <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a> has graciously sponsored the judging platform.

                    <b>Contest Format</b>
                    Teams of up to three students enrolled in an Albertan educational institution, meeting the criteria linked to in the "Eligibility" section above may compete for prizes. 
                    Teams not meeting these requirements may participate in the open division. The contest is free of charge for entry. The contest will be held in-person, using Kattis.
                    <br><br>
                    Don't have a group of people to participate in the event with but you're looking to meet some new people? 
                    No worries! We'll be working to team folks up after you sign up on this Google sheet form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXtoKHKP_Yt7_LdzAA_mJtlWB-I2zRI2_hMvk4QAgn7PWFhA/viewform">here</a>
                    <br><br>
                    The contest itself is a collection of 6-10 problems to be solved using the <a href="https://open.kattis.com/languages">language of your choice</a>. Team rankings are decided first by number of problems solved, and second by time taken to solve.
                    For each problem, your program will be given input describing a test case.
                    It must then provide appropriate output giving the answer to whatever problem was posed.
                    Once you have written a solution to the problem, you must submit the solution on <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a>.
                    Your code will be subject to a large battery of tests.
                    If your code returns correct output on every test case and runs within time and memory limits, the solution is accepted.
                    Otherwise, it will be rejected. 
                    You will be told how your program failed, but will not be given details of the failed test case.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Official Rules:</i>

                        <li> No collaboration is allowed with anyone outside of your team members when working on/discussing the contest problems. </li>
                        <li> All teams will be provided with a single workstation in the contest area. Only that workstation may be used during the contest. Any team member can submit a solution to Kattis. </li>
