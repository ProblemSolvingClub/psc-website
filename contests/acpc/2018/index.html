            <b>About</b>

            <p>
            The Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC) is an opportunity for university and college students in Alberta to excel in a programming competition.
            </p>

            <p>
            Students will test their aptitude and their knowledge of computer science against a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved within five hours. The event will begin on October 27th with a warm-up practice, followed by a five-hour competition to decide the winners. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The ACPC is sponsored by <a href="http://www.arcurve.com/">Arcurve</a> who provides a platform for the next generation of computing professionals to pursue excellence. <a href="https://www.kattis.com/">Kattis</a> has graciously sponsored the judging platform.

			</p>
			<p>
                During the contest, the following rules are in effect:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Internet/network access is restricted to standard library and language documentation, the contest website, and the I/O cheat-sheet (linked below)</li>
                <li>Teams have unlimited access to written material such as textbooks, notes, and printed example code</li>
                <li>Use of electronic devices other than the computer is strictly prohibited</li>
                <li>Teams are ranked according to which has solved the most problems, with ties broken by time taken to solve</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

			<b>Preparation &amp; Strategy</b>
                <p>
                If you want a leg up on the competition, there are some preparation opportunities available:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>In Calgary, the <a href="http://cpc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/">Competitive Programming Club</a> meets every Wednesday from 18:00 - 21:00 in MS 160 for coaching &amp; practice</li>
                <li>The <a href="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/">UVa Online Judge</a> contains many programming puzzles for self-directed practice</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Some time-tested strategies for during the competition:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Read all the problems, identify the easy ones, and solve them first</li>
                <li>If you're having trouble identifying easy problems, look at the scoreboard to see what others are solving</li>
                <li>Computer time is very valuable, so sketch out your program on paper before coding it (unless it's trivially simple)</li>
                <!--<li>Working together on a problem is usually a bad idea and just leads to confusion; assign problems, work in parallel</li>-->
                <li>Debugging a program on paper is more effective than sticking print statements everywhere, 99% of the time</li>
                <li>Come up with your own test cases for your program, especially edge cases</li>
                </ul>
