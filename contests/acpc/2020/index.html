            <b>About</b>

            <p>
            The Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC) is an opportunity for university and college students in Alberta to excel in a programming competition.
            </p>

            <p>
            Students will test their aptitude and their knowledge of computer science against a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved within five hours. The event will begin on Saturday, November 14th with a warm-up practice, followed by a five-hour competition to decide the winners. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The ACPC is sponsored by <a href="http://www.arcurve.com/">Arcurve</a> who provides a platform for the next generation of computing professionals to pursue excellence.

            <b>Contest Details &amp; Rules</b>
			<p>
				Teams of up to three students enrolled in an Albertan educational institution, meeting the criteria linked to in the "Eligibility" section above may compete for prizes. Teams not meeting these requirements may participate as guests. The contest is free of charge for entry.
			</p>
			<p>
				The contest itself is a collection of 8-10 problems to be solved using C, C++, Java, and Python. Team rankings are decided first by number of problems solved, and second by time taken to solve.
			</p>
			<p>
                During the contest, the following rules are in effect:
            </p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>No collaboration is allowed with anyone outside of your team members when working on/discussing the contest problems.</li>
                <li>All contestants can work on their personal computer. Any team member can submit a solution to Kattis. </li>
 		        <li>Resource access is restricted to standard library and language documentation, the contest website, and the I/O cheat-sheet (linked below)</li>
                    <ul><li> External libraries are not allowed. For example, the C++ header '#include &lt;math.h&gt;'
                    is allowed since it is a part of the language's standard library. 
                    However, headers in an external C++ library such as Boost are not allowed.</li></ul>
     
                <li>Teams have unlimited access to textbooks and personal pre-written code</li>
                <li>Aside from the two main points above, all other references materials on the internet are not allowed</li>
                <li>Use of electronic devices other than the computer is strictly prohibited</li>
                <li>Teams are ranked according to which has solved the most problems, with ties broken by time taken to solve</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://acpc17.kattis.com/">main contest</a>
                will start at 1:00PM MDT on Saturday, November 14th. The <a href="https://open.kattis.com/contests/acpc17practice">practice contest</a> starts one hour before the main contest and will last 45 minutes. Participation in the practice is optional but recommended for new competitors.

			<b>Preparation &amp; Strategy</b>
                <p>
                If you want a leg up on the competition, there are some preparation opportunities available:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>In Calgary, the <a href="http://cpc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/">Competitive Programming Club</a> meets every Wednesday from 18:00 - 21:00 remotely through a youtube stream for coaching &amp; practice</li>
                <li>The <a href="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/">UVa Online Judge</a> contains many programming puzzles for self-directed practice</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Some time-tested strategies for during the competition:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Read all the problems, identify the easy ones, and solve them first</li>
                <li>If you're having trouble identifying easy problems, look at the scoreboard to see what others are solving</li>
                <li>Computer time is very valuable, so sketch out your program on paper before coding it (unless it's trivially simple)</li>
                <!--<li>Working together on a problem is usually a bad idea and just leads to confusion; assign problems, work in parallel</li>-->
                <li>Debugging a program on paper is more effective than sticking print statements everywhere, 99% of the time</li>
                <li>Come up with your own test cases for your program, especially edge cases</li>
                </ul>
