                        The Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC) is an opportunity for university and college students in Alberta to excel in a programming competition. </p>
                        <p>Students will test their aptitude and their knowledge of computer science against a set of programming puzzles requiring problem-solving, programming, math, and teamwork skills. 
                            Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved within five hours. 
                            The event will begin on October 26th with a warm-up practice, followed by a five-hour competition to decide the winners.</p>
                             <p>The ACPC is sponsored by <a href="http://www.arcurve.com/">Arcurve</a> who provides a platform for the next generation of computing professionals to pursue excellence.</p>

                        <p>
                        If you want a leg up on the competition, there are some preparation opportunities available:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>In Calgary, the <a href="http://cpc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/">Competitive Programming Club</a> meets every Tuesday from 4:00PM - 6:00PM at <strong> Science Collaborative Space (ST 142)</strong> on the main floor of the science theaters building.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/">UVa Online Judge</a> contains many programming puzzles for self-directed practice</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        Some time-tested strategies for during the competition:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Read all the problems, identify the easy ones, and solve them first</li>
                        <li>If you're having trouble identifying easy problems, look at the scoreboard to see what others are solving</li>
                        <li>Computer time is very valuable, so sketch out your program on paper before coding it (unless it's trivially simple)</li>
                        <!--<li>Working together on a problem is usually a bad idea and just leads to confusion; assign problems, work in parallel</li>-->
                        <li>Debugging a program on paper is more effective than sticking print statements everywhere, 99% of the time</li>
                        <li>Come up with your own test cases for your program, especially edge cases</li>
