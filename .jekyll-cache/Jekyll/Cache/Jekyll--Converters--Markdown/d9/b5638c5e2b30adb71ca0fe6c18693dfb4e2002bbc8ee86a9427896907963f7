Thank you all for attending 2015 ACPC, it was a ton of fun for us to set up. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did! 
<br /><br />
Congratulations to the winners of Division 1, team <b>Chocolate Truffle</b>, who solved 7 problems. 
<br /><br />

As for Division 2, congratulations to team <b>Last Place</b> for taking first place and solving all of the problems. Got to love the irony of their team name.
