<p>Competitive Programming Club (CPC) with the help of Synopsys as official sponsor, is once again hosting the Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC). We hope you can join us March 17th from 10AM to 6PM. We will be serving coffee and lunch, and a talk by Synopsys. We have two divisions, so we strongly encourage first year students to test their skills in the contest.
<br />
<b>The deadline to register for the contest is March 15th, but capacity is limited and has historically sold out! With that being said, you can register and find full contest details by clicking through the poster below or buttons above!
<br /> ** Please note not all languages may be able to produce a solution to some questions.
