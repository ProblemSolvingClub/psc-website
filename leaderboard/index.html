  <p>
    Compete against fellow CPC members by solving problems! Every problem you solve on one of the below websites
    will count as a point.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Points will begin accumulating on January 15th and stop on March 28th.  Prizes will be announced during the final meeting!</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are 5 tiers based on your point total: Bits, Bytes, Integers, Floats and Doubles.  Tiers above 'Bits' are achieved by earning 25, 50, 100, and 125 total points.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bonus points can be received by attending our Wednesday meetings.  Solving problems in the practice contests during meetings will also grant bonus points!
  </p>

  <p>
    The members with the most points will win prizes including a lunch with the CTO of Arcurve.
    <strong>In order to get added to the leaderboard, you will need to consult a CPC executive.</strong>
