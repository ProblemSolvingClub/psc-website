<b>2018!</b>
<br><br>
Just wanted to welcome everyone back into the new year 2018. As the semester gets going and that add/drop deadline nears, note that our first official meeting will be Wednesday 17th! Same time and location, MS160 at 6PM. In other news, we are also resetting the leaderboard. If you're not familar, we track attendance and problems solved on our weekly contests. We have prizes from Google, Synopsys, Arcurve to give out. Of course, the top members with points will get to have lunch with the Chief Tech Officer of Arcurve. Perfect opportunity to slide over a resume, don't ya think? See more here  <a href ="http://psc.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/leaderboard/"> here </a> <br><br>

Lastly, we are ALWAYS looking for new members to fill our competitive roster. If you're interested in competing, don't hesitate! <br>
We are always looking for people as long as they have the willingness to learn. Beginner or veteran, everyone starts somewhere.<br>
So please, if you are interested, come by and speak to an exec!
