    Interested in becoming a PSC executive?
    You will learn how an organization works internally, 
    how to plan and prepare for events as a team, network with sponsors,
    and earn CCR hours. From working with the CPSC department to hosting 
    workshops, youâ€™ll pick up many new skills as an executive.
    <br><br>
    As an executive, you will attend weekly Wednesday meetings, aid in 
    preparing for programming contests (CCPC & ACPC), help new members 
    get settled in, and learn the ins and outs of what makes us the 
    Problem Solving Club. Along with that, you can help out with workshops, 
    and possibly work on our website, leaderboard, or anything else that 
    you are interested in.
