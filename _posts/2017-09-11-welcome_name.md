Welcome back! The club wishes everyone the best in their semester. We have a lot of events in store so check back for updates. <br>
Join our mailing list to ensure you don't miss out on updates and event sign-ups. We are also having our first meeting September 13th at 6pm in MS 160. See you then! 
<br><br>

Officially this semester, Problem Solving Club (PSC) is renaming itself as Competitive Programming Club (CPC). This name change came about as a decision to better reflect the Club's history, mission, and competitive spirit. We still look forward to helping the undergraduate computer science base at large.  But we are focusing more than ever on instilling an attitude of learning and improving one's programming skills, especially in a competitive environment. <br>
Stop by at one of our meetings to check out what competitive programming is about. Beginner or expert, we have content in store to appeal to everyone.
You'll improve your interview and programming skills at the very least!
