    This Wednesday, November 16, Dr. Hoyer will be teaching a session on 
    dynamic programming.
    <br><br>
    Dynamic programming problems are quite prevalent in both programming
    contests and in technical interviews at companies like Facebook, Google,
    Microsoft, etc., so having a good understanding will make you really stand
    out.
    <br><br>
    To give perspective, there were two dynamic programming problems in the last 
    ACPC, and the top 3 teams were the ones who were able to solve those problems.
    Understanding how to solve these problems might make the difference between 
    placing 15th and in the top 3.
