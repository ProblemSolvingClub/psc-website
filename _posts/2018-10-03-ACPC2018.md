Competitive Programming Club (CPC) with the help of Arcuve as official sponsor, is once again hosting the Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC). We hope you can join us this October 27th from 10:30AM to 6PM. We will be serving coffee and lunch, and a talk by Arcurve. We have two divisions, so we strongly encourage first year students to test their skills in the contest.
<br>
<b>The deadline to register for the contest is Oct 25th (4:00PM MST), but capacity is limited and has historically sold out! With that being said, you can register and find full contest details by clicking through the official poster or buttons above!
<p> ** Please note not all languages may be able to produce a solution to some questions.
