text: Happy reading week! The competitive programming club is hosting a resume workshop featuring a senior software engineer at Synopsis, Matthew Dumont, next Friday from 5-7 pm. This means there is no lecture this week. If you are still itching to solve problems the resume workshop will host 2 bug hunts where the winner can earn a chance to get their resume reviewed by Matthew and the director of software engineering at Synopsis, Tyler Sims, who will also be joining us for Q&A and networking.
