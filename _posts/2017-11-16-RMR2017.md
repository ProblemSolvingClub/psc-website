<b>UCalgary places three teams!</b>
<br><br>
This past weekend, we sent three teams of our best and brightest to the Rocky Mountain Regionals. We placed 4th, 8th, and 25th out of 52 teams!
The rocky mountain region include schools down the corridor of North America, so schools from Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Sask, Montana, and Alberta competed. You can check out full stats and standings in the official kattis page <a href ="https://rmc17.kattis.com/standings"> here</a>. <br><br>

That being said, we are ALWAYS looking for new members to fill our competitive roster. If you're interested in competing, don't hesitate! <br>
We are always looking for people as long as they have the willingness to learn. Beginner or veteran, everyone starts somewhere.<br>
So please, if you are interested, come to a Wednesday meeting at 6PM in the CPSC labs (MS 160) and speak to one of the executives.<br>
C'ya then!
