<b>UCalgary places three teams!</b>
<br>
This past weekend, we sent three teams of our best and brightest to the Rocky Mountain Regionals. We placed 4th, 8th, and 25th out of 52 teams! <br>
The rocky mountain region include schools down the corridor of North America, so schools from Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Sask, Montana, and Alberta competed. 
 <br><br>
 You can check out full stats and standings after the break <br> <a href ="https://rmc17.kattis.com/standings"> Rocky Mountain Regionals 2017 </a> <br>

That being said, we are ALWAYS looking for new members to fill our competitive roster. If you're interested in competing, don't hesitate! <br>
We are always looking for people as long as they have the willingness to learn. Beginner or veteran, everyone starts somewhere.<br>
So please, if you are interested, come to a Wednesday meeting at 6PM in the CPSC labs (MS 160) and speak to one of the executives.<br>
