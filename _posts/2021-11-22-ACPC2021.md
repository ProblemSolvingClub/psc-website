text: Competitive Programming Club (CPC) with the help of Arcuve as official sponsor, is once again hosting the Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC). We hope you can join us this November 27th from 10:30AM to 6:20PM for this fully online event! This is the perfect event for students to demonstrate and test their problem-solving abilities through programming. We have three divisions, so we strongly encourage first-year students to test their skills in the contest and anyone who wants to join. The third division is not open to prizes. The deadline to register for the contest is Thursday, November 25, 2021 at 10:00pm MST, but capacity is limited and has historically sold out! With that being said, you can register and find full contest details by clicking on the poster below or buttons above! ** Please note not all languages may be able to produce a solution to some questions.
