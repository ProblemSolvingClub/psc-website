<p><br>Welcome back to the winter semester! We are excited to announce that the Calgary Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) will take place on March 14, 2020. 
CCPC is hosted by us (CPC) along with the help of our official sponsor, Synopsys. </p>

<p>There will also be lunch and coffee served at the event, along with a talk by Synopsys. 
This is the perfect event for students to demonstrate and test their problem-solving abilities through programming. We have two divisions, 
so we strongly encourage first-year students to test their skills in the contest.
</p>

<p><b>The deadline to register for the contest is <u>March 11, 2020 at 10:30AM MST</u>, but capacity is limited and has historically sold out! With that being said,
