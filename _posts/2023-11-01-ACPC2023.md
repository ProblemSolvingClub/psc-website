text: Competitive Programming Club (CPC) with the help of Arcuve as official sponsor, is once again hosting the Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC). We hope you can join us this November 25th from 10:00AM to 6:00PM for this in-person event! This is the perfect event for students to demonstrate and test their problem-solving abilities through programming. We have two divisions, so we strongly encourage first-year students to test their skills in the contest and anyone who wants to join. The third/open division is not open to prizes and does not require registration. The deadline to register for the contest is Wednesday, November 22nd, 2023 at 10:45pm MST, but capacity is limited and has historically sold out! With that being said, you can register and find full contest details by clicking on the buttons above! ** Please note not all languages may be able to produce a solution to some questions.
