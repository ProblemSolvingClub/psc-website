Competitive Programming Club (CPC) with the help of Arcuve is once again hosting the Alberta Collegiate Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC).<br><br>

After hosting the event for some time now, student feed back on the event has revolved around a few things: challenging, learning team-work, and testing their knowledge. This has made us feel the contest has definitely helped the immediate computer science students in the Alberta region and we are honored to host this once more. <br><br>

We hope you can join us this October 14 from 10AM to 6PM for the contest. We will be serving coffee and lunch, and with talks by Arcurve. We have two divisions, so we strongly encourage first year students to test their skills in the contest. Total Prizes available come together in at over a little over $2500 in cash. So show us your competitive streak! Even if that does not sound like your cup of coffee, the event is great for team building and an opportunity to check out our corporate sponsor.The contest is graciously sponsored by Arcurve, an independent software development and services company. <br><br>

With that being said, you can register and find full contest details by clicking through the official poster below!
