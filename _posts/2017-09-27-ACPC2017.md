Competitive Programming Club (CPC) with the help of Arcuve is once again hosting the Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC).<br><br>

After hosting the event for some time now, student feed back on the event has revolved around a few things: challenge their skills, utilize team-work, and testing their overall knowledge. This has made us feel the contest has definitely helped the immediate computer science students in the Alberta region and we are honored to host this once more. <br><br>

We hope you can join us this October 14th from 10AM to 6PM. We will be serving coffee and lunch, and a talk by Arcurve. We have two divisions, so we strongly encourage first year students to test their skills in the contest. Total Prizes available come together in at a little over $2500 in cash. So show us your competitive streak! Even if that does not sound like your cup of coffee, the event is great for team building and an opportunity to check out our corporate sponsor. The contest is graciously sponsored by Arcurve, an independent software development and services company. Simply by doing these contests and problems will better prepare you for technical interviews in the future! <br><br>

<b>With that being said, you can register and find full contest details by clicking through the official poster below!</b>
