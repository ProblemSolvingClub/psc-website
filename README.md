# Website for the Problem Solving Club

## Local development setup
1. Install jekyll via `gem install jekyll`
2. Run `jekyll build` to process the website into `_site`
3. Run `jekyll serve` to host the site on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
Optional: instead of steps 2 and 3, just run `jekyll serve --watch` which will watch for changes to files and build/serve every time a file is changed
